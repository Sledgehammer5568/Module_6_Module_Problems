# Module_6_Module_Problems

# The Random Module
This module provides access to functions that support the generation of random numbers. You
can find all of the random functions
here:https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#module-random

**Problem 1**: 
Use a for loop and random.randrange to print 10 random integers between
25 and 35.

**Problem 2**: 
Use random.randrange to print an odd integer between 0 and 100.

**Problem 3**: 
Use random.choice to select a day of the week from a list and print that day.

# The Math Module
This module provides access to many mathematical functions. You can find all of the math
functions here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#module-math

**Problem 4**:
“Write a program that will compute the area of a circle. Prompt the user to enter the radius and
print a nice message back to the user with the answer.”
But this time, use math.pi from the math module in the equation.
Equation for the area of a circle: Area = pi * radius^2

**Problem 5**: 
Write a program that takes two user inputs, a and b, and uses them to calculate the
Pythagorean theorem using the sqrt() and pow() functions found in the math module.
Here's the equation:
c= √ a2+ b2

**Problem 6**: 
Write a program that takes a number from a user and calculates the factorial of that
number in two ways:
1) Using a for loop to calculate the factorial of a user input value.
2) Using the math module. You’ll need to do some research to find the function you need.

Be sure to print both answers.
